Global-Photo

"When you see something beautiful, it's natural to feel a desire to claim or even own it yourself in some way - and also to share it with others."

Our app Global Photo allows a user to accomplish both, by sharing their photo and exactly when and where they took their beautiful photo.

Other Global Photo users who like a beautiful photo and would like to visit the same location can. By clicking on a photo a map will display with a pin indicating its location.
