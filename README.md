Global-Photo

"When you see something beautiful, it's natural to feel a desire to claim or even own it yourself in some way - and also to share it with others."

Our app Global Photo allows a user to accomplish both.
      1. By sharing their beautiful photo 
      2. And exactly when and where they took it

Other Global Photo users who like a beautiful photo and would like to visit the same location can. 
      1. By clicking on a beautiful photo 
      2. And a map will be displayed with a pin indicating its location
